# Marketing AI v3 - MVP Implementation Plan

This document outlines a focused MVP implementation plan for extending the Marketing AI application. This plan prioritizes a single end-to-end user journey (Market Analysis → Content Generation) while maintaining simplicity and rapid development.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Incremental Development:** Focus on high-impact, simple features first. Build and validate each feature before moving to the next.
*   **LLM Agnostic:** Continue enhancing the `ProviderHandler` for multiple LLM providers, adding Google Gemini, OpenRouter, and OpenAI support for maximum flexibility and multimodal capabilities.
*   **Data Persistence:** Implement SQLite database for user data, brand assets, and content history to create a persistent marketing workspace.
*   **Secure by Design:** Maintain focus on secure API key management and input validation.
*   **Streamlit Simplicity:** Keep the UI clean and intuitive using Streamlit's capabilities.
*   **Market Intelligence Focus:** Prioritize features that provide actionable marketing insights.

## MVP Development Phases

### MVP Phase 1: Foundation (2-3 weeks)
Establish core infrastructure for the single user journey.

*   **1.1. Minimal Code Refactoring:**
    *   Extract core functions from `market_agent.py` into separate modules.
    *   Remove duplicate code between files.
    *   Simplify LLM handling for initial providers (Groq + OpenAI only).
*   **1.2. Basic Database Setup:**
    *   Implement SQLite for project and content persistence.
    *   Simple schema: projects, generated_content, user_preferences.
    *   Milestone: User can create a project that persists across sessions.
*   **1.3. Simplified RAG System:**
    *   Extend existing FAISS implementation for document retrieval.
    *   Basic relevance filtering with similarity thresholds.
    *   Focus on document-based context injection.
*   **1.4. UI Polish:**
    *   Clean up interface and improve navigation.
    *   Add project-based organization.

### MVP Phase 2: Market Intelligence Core (2-3 weeks)
Deliver the primary value proposition.

*   **2.1. Market Analysis Agent (MVP Focus):**
    *   Build agent using existing document processing + simplified RAG.
    *   Generate market insights based on uploaded business documents.
    *   Milestone: Complete end-to-end market analysis workflow.
*   **2.2. Enhanced Post Composer Integration:**
    *   Connect market analysis results to content generation.
    *   Use market insights as context for content creation.
    *   Milestone: Generate content informed by market analysis.

### MVP Phase 3: Content Enhancement (2 weeks)
Add visual capabilities to complete the content package.

*   **3.1. Basic Image Generation:**
    *   Integrate Gemini for simple image generation.
    *   Text-prompt based generation (defer complex brand asset integration).
    *   Milestone: Generate images to accompany text content.
*   **3.2. Content Performance Scoring:**
    *   Basic engagement potential scoring.
    *   Simple optimization suggestions.

### Future Phases (Post-MVP)

*   **Competitor Analysis Agent**
*   **Advanced Brand Asset Integration**
*   **Multiple LLM Provider Support**
*   **Analytics Dashboard**
*   **A/B Testing Framework**
*   **Advanced RAG Features**

## Technology Stack (Updated)

*   **Backend/Core:** Python
*   **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit
*   **Database:** SQLite
*   **LLMs:** Groq, OpenAI (initial), Gemini (for images), Ollama, OpenRouter (future)
*   **Image Generation:** Google Gemini
*   **Vector Database:** FAISS
*   **Embeddings Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
*   **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud or cloud provider

## MVP Success Criteria

**Primary User Journey:** Upload business documents → Get market analysis → Generate informed content → Create accompanying images

**Key Milestones:**
1. **Week 2:** Database persistence working - users can save projects
2. **Week 4:** Market Analysis Agent delivers actionable insights
3. **Week 5:** Content generation uses market insights as context
4. **Week 7:** Basic image generation completes the content package

**MVP Launch Requirements:**
- Single end-to-end workflow working reliably
- Data persistence across sessions
- Clean, professional UI
- Basic relevance in generated content
- Functional image generation

This simplified plan focuses on core marketing intelligence while maintaining development velocity and user value.
